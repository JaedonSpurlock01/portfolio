# Introduction
Hey guys, thanks for checking out this portfolio.

# More about me
I'm not a typical fan of giving long text on my pages, since almost no one would ever read the entire thing.
But i'll try to be relatively brief.

My name is Jaedon Spurlock, i'm originally from small town Ohio, but I moved to Oceanside, California in 2020
in pursuit of greater tech opportunities. 

# What custom

For the code theme, I am using the <>Lambda Studio â€” Blackout</> VSCode theme. Check it out here!

```typescript
export default function hello() {
  return (
    <div className="mt-10 text-lg font-bold">
      <p>Hello World</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
