Here's a single-file MDX content example that includes everything within one file:

```mdx
# Welcome to My MDX Page!

This is a simple example of an **MDX** page that combines markdown with JSX components. MDX allows you to use markdown syntax alongside React components for a richer content experience.

## Section 1: Introduction

MDX is an excellent way to create content-rich pages. You can add headings, lists, links, and more:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

You can even add inline code:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Section 2: Interactive Components

Here is a simple interactive counter component:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

<Counter />
```

## Section 3: Advanced Topics

### 3.1 Nested Lists

You can even create nested lists within your content:

1. First level
   - Second level
     - Third level
2. Another first-level item

### 3.2 Custom Component Example

Here is an example of a custom component being used in MDX:

```jsx
import { Card } from './components/Card';

<Card title="This is a card" content="This is some content inside the card component." />
```

## Section 4: Conclusion

MDX is a powerful tool for integrating React components into markdown. It provides flexibility and allows you to create dynamic content with ease.

> "MDX makes React components part of your markdown."
