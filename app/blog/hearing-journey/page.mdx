# Humble Beginnings
I aspire on a philosophy that emphasizes a relentless pursuit of excellence and a commitment to constantly improving ones self. As someone who has traversed through life with a hearing disability, I have found solace and motivation in navigating a world of diversity and exclusion.

In a world that often tries to define and limit us by our differences, I sought to always find the good in another person, seeing past their differences and accepting them for who they are.

# Cochlear Implants
On my head, I wear what is called a Cochlear Implant, a small, rectangular device that sits behind my ear.

This device is a sound processor that connects to a magnet under my skin, which allows me to hear through the stimulation of auditory nerves in my cochlea. Although I never had natural hearing, you could describe this sensation as listening to the world through headphones as sounds come through the device in a series of beeps and whistles.

I received my first implant in 2005 in Honolulu, Hawaii, and the second in 2007 in Denver, Colorado. At that time, the prospect of bionic hearing brought uncertainty to the deaf community, but also immeasurable promise of the gift of hearing. With a hint of doubt and hesitation, my parents ultimately chose to take a chance at giving me the gift of hearing.

The surgeries went surprisingly well, and I was supposed to grow up with two working ears. Unfortunately though, my right side struggled to function normally. The audiologist at the time determined that the cochlea in my right ear was too damaged to be replaced with the technology available at the time. She suggested to my parents that I should just stick with my left cochlear implant, as it was supposedly enough to hear sufficiently anyway. So in the fullness of time, I grew up deaf on my right side, and I would only be able to hear on my left side with a cochlear implant.

Despite the remarkable benefits of my cochlear implant, there were still minor inconveniences that came with the gift of hearing. Each night, I had to remove my implant for recharging, and I had to take it off before engaging in aquatic activities like showering or swimming. During those times, I would not be able to hear or communicate to others. The most significant hurdle I had to overcome was not being able to hear on my right side. This created difficulties in everyday situations like trying to follow group conversations or hearing approaching traffic. The hearing imbalance also made it impossible for me to have directional hearing, meaning that I could not distinguish sounds that came from different directions.

However, with time and practice, I learned to adapt. I developed strategies to reduce the complexity of left-side hearing, such as standing on the right side when talking to peers, sitting in the front-right side of classrooms, and also advocating for myself to make sure that people understood my disability. With these strategies I developed over the years, I improved my hearing comprehension little by little.

# My hometown
Growing up in a military family, I moved often, but I eventually settled in Ohio with my mother after my parents divorce. She wanted me to live in a stable environment, be able to enjoy the company of my grandparents, and not have to transfer from school to school. For most of my life, Ive lived in the city of Marion, a small football kind of town. It was out in the country, just north of Columbus. It was a small, close-knit community where everyone knew each other. 

In my early years of school, I was placed under the Individualized Education Program (IEP), an initiative that aims to provide accommodations for learners with specific needs. My teachers were equipped with microphones that connected to my hearing processor. While the use of this accommodation was meant to aid my learning, I never felt it was used effectively. I struggled to hear on my right side, and though the microphone was intended to help, it often emitted static noise, disrupting my learning. Despite my avoided use of the aid, my advisors insisted that I continue to use the microphone. I ignored them, and instead relied on my own academic aptitude.

My academic success without the use of the accommodation led to my eventual removal from the IEP program -- a rare occurrence for students within the system. According to the administration, being removed from the program happened less than one percent of the time with all kids under the system.

I stuck with River Valley until halfway through high school, when COVID appeared in 2020, where I made a difficult decision and moved to Oceanside, California.

# Where I am today
The legacy of Kobe Bryant and his 'mamba mentality' has inspired people from all walks of life to push beyond their limits and strive for greatness. I didnt understand at the time just how much he has inspired others. When I learned of his death in 2020, it began to make me appreciate the impact he had on peoples lives. It reminded me that life is precious and that we should effectively make the most of every moment. Since then, Ive made a conscious effort to embark on a constant quest to be the best version of myself. Ive learned to cultivate this mindset, and it has helped me define who I am today.

Like many others, my life up to this point has only been the beginning of a book filled with chapters, some good and bad. Going on about 20 years with a hearing disability, I've learned to accept and adapt life with cochlear implants.
